### PHP 8 `create_function`

Pure PHP implementation of the venerable (but flawed) [`create_function`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.create-function.php) function, which has been [removed in PHP 8](https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/ee16d99504f0014c3d292809da927fb622293f41).

#### Motivation

When benchmarking an [anonymous function](https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php) replacement for sorting via [`usort`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.usort.php) with the callback being generated by `create_function` based on several nested sorting criteria, I noticed a substantial decrease in performance between the two. Given that this particular use case has hard-coded inputs to `create_function`, this seems a sufficiently safe way to proceed.


#### Implementation

Looking at the implementation for `create_function` in PHP 7.4.16 [here](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/php-7.4.16/Zend/zend_builtin_functions.c#L1857-L1923), we see that the rough process is to:

* build a string of the form:

```
function __lambda_func($args){$code}
```

* evaluate this to create a `__lambda_func` function
* rename the `__lambda_func` function to `\0lambda_X` where `X` is an incrementing counter in the PHP environment, ensuring the resulting function name is unique 

We are unable to replicate this exactly from pure PHP as:

* calling [`eval`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.eval.php) with a created function name matching the inbuilt format (`\0lambda_x`) fails due to an `Unexpected character in input`, and
* there is no sensible way to determine the existing value of the counter

Thus, to ensure a similar level of uniqueness between functions, this implementation uses a hash of the provided arguments, together with a salt that is constant for a given script execution, to generate a name for the function. Additionally, as the hash is a direct representation of the content of the function, this can be used to avoid creating multiple identical functions.
